Rock, Paper, Scissors
=================

This is a simple application I developed while learning angularjs.

Features:

-- Algorithm to make smart guesses based on previous choices

-- Scoreboard

-- Simple statistics

-- Usage of angular Controllers, Dependancy Injection, Modules, and Jasmine Unit Tests (run with Karma)

TODO:

-- Implement a real UI

-- Make the algo even smarter (by weighting based on recency of user input

-- Add a backend so people can save their games

-- Implement user tips, to help the user play smarter
