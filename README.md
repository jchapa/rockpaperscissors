Rock, Paper, Scissors

Simple application I developed to help learn angularjs.

Features:

-- Algorithm to make smart guesses based on previous choices
-- Scoreboard
-- Usage of angular Controllers, Dependancy Injection, Modules, and Jasmine Unit Tests (run with Karma)

TODO:

-- Implement a real UI
-- Make the algo even smarter (by weighting based on recency of user input
-- Add a backend so people can save their games
